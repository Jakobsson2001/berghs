        <h1>🎯 Final Project – Bringing It All Together</h1>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); margin-bottom: 32px; font-size: 17px;">Programming & Methods Pt. 1 • Berghs School of Communication</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In the final part of the course you'll build an individual or small-team project that shows your ability to combine
          <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, frameworks</strong> and <strong>AI-assisted tools</strong>.
          The goal isn't perfection — it's to demonstrate understanding, reflection and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pick a concept you care about: a portfolio, a company site, a small product prototype, or something experimental.
          Make it meaningful and achievable within the timeframe.
        </p>

        <h2>When to Start</h2>
        <p>
          Most focused build time is in the <strong>last week</strong>, but I strongly recommend you start earlier:
          explore ideas, try stacks (React, Tailwind, simple APIs), and set up your repo.
          Starting now makes it easier to ask for help and iterate calmly.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>Git</strong> for version control (frequent commits, branching, PRs).</li>
          <li>Include <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> — or use a framework such as <strong>React</strong>.</li>
          <li><em>Recommended:</em> <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and/or <strong>MUI</strong> for consistent, fast styling.</li>
          <li><em>Recommended:</em> connect to a simple <strong>API</strong> or an <strong>AI model</strong> (optional if cost is an issue).</li>
          <li><em>Optional:</em> host on <strong>Vercel</strong>, <strong>Netlify</strong> or <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Working With or Without a Backend</h2>
        <p>
          If your idea is primarily a <strong>static front-end</strong> (portfolio, company site, landing page), that's fine for the final deliverable.
          To still learn the connection between front-end and back-end, create a separate branch such as
          <code>backend/experiment</code> where you try a lightweight Python/Node API or data handling.
          <strong>Do not merge</strong> this branch into your production branch unless you truly need it.
        </p>

          💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep production clean. Use branches to explore safely.
        </div>

        <h2>GitHub & Collaboration Setup</h2>
        <p>
          Invite me to your repository on GitHub: <strong>jakobsson2001</strong>.
          This lets me review your <em>commit history</em>, <em>branching strategy</em> and overall Git hygiene.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Work in <strong>branches</strong> (e.g., <code>feature/...</code>, <code>fix/...</code>, <code>experiment/...</code>).</li>
          <li>Open <strong>pull requests</strong> (PRs) to merge changes — even when working solo.</li>
          <li><strong>Review your own PRs</strong> or use AI tools (Cursor Auto Mode, Lovable, Copilot) to comment on diffs.</li>
          <li>Prefer <strong>Squash &amp; merge</strong> to keep history tidy.</li>
          <li>Write clear, descriptive commit messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Management (Trello + GitHub)</h2>
        <p>
          Create a simple Trello board (Backlog → In Progress → Done). For each card, create a matching branch and PR.
          This gives you checkpoints and makes scope visible. Treat it like a real project, even if you're working alone.
        </p>

        <h2>Two Recommended Workflows</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Option 1 — Start with Lovable:</strong> Prototype quickly, then export or rebuild parts locally in an IDE
            (e.g., Cursor) for finer control, Git discipline, and final polish.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Option 2 — Start directly in Cursor/VS Code:</strong> Full control from day one with strong Git workflow.
            Still use AI assistance to accelerate (Cursor Auto Mode, Copilot, etc.).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Choose the path that fits how you like to work. Remember: <em>we don't want to reinvent the wheel</em> —
          use frameworks and libraries to move faster and focus on design, logic, and content.
        </p>

        <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
        <h3>Pass (P)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Shows understanding of fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS, Git).</li>
          <li>Working front-end with at least one interactive element.</li>
          <li>Consistent Git usage (commits/branches/PRs) and a clear repo.</li>
          <li><strong>README.md</strong> (markdown format) with short reflection on process and learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pass with Distinction (PD)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Demonstrates independent problem solving and thoughtful design choices.</li>
          <li>Explores back-end concepts/APIs/data handling (a separate branch is acceptable).</li>
          <li>Smart, transparent use of AI-assisted tools with notes in the README.md.</li>
          <li>Professional Git workflow: branches, PRs, reviews, and clean history (squash merges).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: var(--muted); margin-top: 12px;">
          <em>Note:</em> Frameworks (React, Tailwind, MUI) are recommended but not required. Using HTML/CSS is perfectly acceptable — choose the approach that best fits your project.
        </p>

        <h2>Presentation & Submission</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Final presentations: <strong>around November 26</strong>.</li>
          <li>Submit your <strong>GitHub repository link</strong> via Canvas. The <strong>README.md</strong> (markdown format) should be in your repository — it's not too important to post it separately on Canvas since I can view it directly on GitHub where it will render nicely.</li>
          <li>If deployed, include the <strong>live link</strong> (optional but encouraged).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="color: var(--muted);">
